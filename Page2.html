Mukha naman siyang okay during our lectures but there was this one time I was just passing by the lab and I saw him through the window. He kept on screaming "AYOKO NAAA! MAY GALIT ATA SAKIN TONG BOOTSTRAP NA TO AYAW GUMANA CODE KO!!! PALABASIN NYO NAKO DITO! 12 HOURS NAKO NAGCOCODING DAPAT BINABAYARAN AKO PARA DITO!!! SINO BA KASI NAGPAUSO NG CODING!"
